Our code is now finished to such an extent that we can show our client Kristian the result.
Therefore, we have agreed to do a skype meeting with him where we will screenshare as we try out the program
with instructions from Kristian.
We have also revisted our class diagram for the last time to update it with the small refinements made to the code.
Also, we have made a user manual for the program which explains how the program
should be set up the first time when it is launched as well as a description of it's general usage. Finally we
have solved the OSCA assignment and thus finished it's coding part.

Next time we will have the skype meeting with Kristian and start finalising the report and the project as a whole.
