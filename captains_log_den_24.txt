Today we continued refining our code by adding features such as being able to save certificates, add participants,
and some other small refinements such as adding FTP libraries and fixing the 'MySQLSettings' class. However
we are starting to feel the productivity level is falling, as we have now been working on the project for quite some time.
We will have to tackle this problem by keeping spirits high here in the final part of the work, as the hand in date
is now but a week away.

Next time we will aim to finalise the code by adding the final rifinements and comments to the code. 
We hope to do this as we can then start adding all our work to the report and thereby start finishing the project as a whole.
